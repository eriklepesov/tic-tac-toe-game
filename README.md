# Tic Tac Toe in Python ðŸŽ®

This is a simple two-player **Tic Tac Toe** game written in Python. It's designed to be easy to understand and perfect for beginners who want to learn basic programming concepts.

## Features
- Two-player mode (no AI)
- Input validation for player moves
- Clear win/draw detection
- Console-based user interface

## Why I Made This
I originally created this game as part of a module during my time at the **University of Aberdeen**, where I studied Applied Mathematics. It was a fun and practical way to demonstrate understanding of:
- Conditional logic (`if`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Arrays (using lists)
- Functions and control flow

Later, I improved and documented the code for use in my application to the Accenture Modern Engineering Graduate Programme.

## How to Play
1. Clone this repo or download the `.py` file.
2. Open your terminal.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python tic_tac_toe_game_human.py
   ```
4. Take turns entering your moves using row and column numbers (e.g., `0 1`).

## Example Board
```
X | O | X
---------
  | X | O
---------
O |   | X
```
